# The Game State Object #

_Taken from "Object-Oriented Game Design" by Britt L. Hannah._

To better define an object that is capable of interacting with another object, we use states. Objects that interact are essentially exhibiting behavior, and states can be considered as instantaneous behavior, or behavior at a specific point in time. This is where most game implementations throw reusability out the window. Game implementations tend to define very specialized classes with states carved in granite. Optimization is the primary culprit in this process of game implementation. There are places for primitive states in a class, but a reusable class needs to be considered extremely carefully before adding in states of that nature. This game development system uses State classes to represent data that entities need in order to interact with each other. These State classes help compose, or in other words define, the Form class and the Entity class, and are used at runtime by the Action object to modify an Entity objects apparent behavior. In essence, the behavior of Form and Entity objects at runtime, as well as Action objects, is controlled and modified through State objects in this system.

The benefits of using a state class instead of specialized primitive variables to constrain the behavior of entities are twofold. First, once a State class has itself been defined, the game development system can utilize that State class to define any game token in any game implemented with the system. Secondly, entities can be queried for the existence of a State object at runtime by another entity, and if the entity queried possesses that State object the entity can be interacted with by the entity performing the query. The implications of this are quite interesting. Two game token objects that were designed totally oblivious to each other (encoded without explicitly referencing the other object) could still interact with each other at runtime due to the nature of the State objects and the relationships they possess. Whoa! Wait a minute, how is this possible? It is possible because we design an Action class that alters or modifies a specific State object that is relative to the type of event that the Action class models. The reasoning behind this is that State objects define and limit the behavior of game tokens, and by altering State objects we indirectly alter the behavior of the entity they define. Therefore, we interact with states and not fully defined entities to keep the system general and flexible. In so doing we disconnect the game token from its dependence on specific data. And, this allows much greater freedom in the implementation of an Entity class.

As an analogy, let’s suppose we have a game token that represents a car, the behavior of which we wish to modify. Let’s say the car is a fast car and we want to make it go even faster. However, what we do not want to do is make the car faster. If we were to make the car faster, we could only affect the behavior of that car. Instead, we make the "fast" faster, and therefore ANY game token car that can go "fast" can be affected if we so choose. Much more importantly, not only could any token representing a car be affected, also, ANY game token with a "fast" behavior could potentially be modified regardless of what it is meant to represent. And, it could use the same modification method. It may sound silly at first, but think about it for a while. Potentially, very powerful optimizations lie down this path. The definition of the Action object and its relationships, which lies ahead, will help make the way this system is designed become clearer.

Before continuing, however, the issue of reflection technology needs some mention. It could be argued that through reflection technology, which most modern OOP languages possess, primitive states could be used in a general way. Through reflection, most objects can be queried and their associated fields and methods can be discovered. Yet, the use of reflection technology would also keep the system dependent on the object-oriented framework through which it was utilized. Therefore, this game development system currently implements its own State objects to track the data of its Entity objects. In this way the game development system I am describing could itself be developed using any language desired or is considered important at the time.
